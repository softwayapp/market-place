## 1. Internal Marketplace Concepts

### 1.1 Definition | 정의

**English:**
An **internal/enterprise marketplace** is a complex ecommerce platform operated by large organizations or industry leaders that facilitates transactions by connecting large organizations as buyers with multiple third-party sellers of high-value, custom, or specialized goods and services. These are proprietary platforms owned and operated by a single company designed to optimize the company's internal ecosystem, connecting suppliers, partners, and customers to streamline procurement, sales, or service processes.

**한국어:**
**사내/기업용 마켓플레이스**는 대규모 조직이나 업계 리더가 운영하는 복잡한 전자상거래 플랫폼으로, 고가치, 맞춤형 또는 특수 상품 및 서비스의 여러 제3자 판매자와 구매자로서 대규모 조직을 연결하여 거래를 촉진합니다. 이는 단일 회사가 소유하고 운영하는 독점 플랫폼으로, 공급업체, 파트너 및 고객을 연결하여 조달, 판매 또는 서비스 프로세스를 간소화하도록 설계되었습니다.
